Viva Energy Group (VEA) – Hold Recommendation
Comany: Viva Energy Group Limited
Ticker: ASX: VEA
Sector: Energy
Date: 30th April 2025

Executive Summary
Viva Energy Group (VEA) is a leading energy company that operates across Australia, Singapore, and Papua New Guinea. Despite facing significant headwinds over the past year, including weak oil-refining margins, high inflationary pressures, and impacts from illicit tobacco trade, VEA has maintained a major market share and strong brand partnerships, notably Shell. While a slow down in domestic inflation may provide some relief to margins and consumer demand, the outlook for refining margins in the global market remains challenging. Our discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation indicates the stock is trading close to fair value, resulting in our recommendation of a HOLD on Viva Energy.

Company Overview
Viva Energy Group operates in three key segments. The Convenience & Mobility division includes over 1,300 service stations and more than 700 convenience stores that operate under the Shell and Coles Express brands. The Commercial & Industrial segment supplies fuels, lubricants, polypropylene, and specialty hydrocarbon products. The Energy & Infrastructure operations are centred around the Geelong Refinery in Victoria, which refines crude oil into petrol, diesel, jet fuel, bitumen, LPG, and specialty chemical products. Industry growth projections across these segments are mixed, with petroleum refining expected have a declining CAGR of 5.1% over the next five years, while bulk fuel storage has a modest growth forecast of 1.6%. Convenience store growth is forecast to be 0.2% annually, typical for the low and steady growth in the energy and utilities industry.

Valuation
Our DCF model estimates an enterprise value of A$6,069 million and an equity value of A$4,272 million, resulting in a fair value share price of just above A$2.65. This valuation is closely aligned with VEA’s current price of A$2.65, highlighting the minimal upside potential of 0.12%. Key assumptions in the model include a WACC of 7.54%, a terminal growth rate of 1.20% and 5-year FCFF projections that have an average annual growth of 10%, with the largest increase being seen in FY25. While VEA demonstrates solid FCFF generation and maintains a strong infrastructure asset holding, valuation metrics suggest limited immediate upside for investors.
 
Investment View
While Viva Energy is expected to benefit from easing inflation pressures domestically and has made structural improvements across its divisions, the ongoing risks of weaker profit margins in the oil refining industry as well as political uncertainties weigh heavily on the near-term outlook. The industry’s broadly stagnant growth forecasts further reinforce a cautious stance. With the shares trading near intrinsic value and the balance of risks and opportunities evenly poised, we maintain a HOLD recommendation on VEA.
